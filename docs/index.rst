Go Elasticsearch Alerts lets you create alerts on your Elasticsearch data. To
get started, just write a :ref:`configuration file <main-config-file>` and a
:ref:`rule <rule-configuration-file>` and you can receive alerts like the Slack
alert shown below when Go Elasticsearch Alerts finds new data matching the rule.
